# Upgrading
To upgrade the current version of PDQTest on your system:

```
gem update pdqtest
```

Each project you want to use the newer version of PDQTest on should then have 
it's `Gemfile.project` updated to reference the latest version.  Don't worry, 
this is easy:

```shell
cd /my/cool/project/to/upgrade
pdqtest upgrade
pdk bundle install
```

Note that since we're using bundler, you only have to upgrade the puppet modules
you want to upgrade.  Existing modules can continue to run any previous version
via `make` just fine. You are not forced to update all your modules in one go.

## Docker image
Updated docker images are periodically released and are required to run newer
PDQTest versions. When you get a message about missing docker containers run:

```shell
pdqtest setup
```

To obtain the latest version.

# PDQTest 1x -> 2x
PDQTest is now compatible with (and requires) PDK! By and large we let PDK do 
its own thing and just wrap the output with emojis and run our own acceptance
tests.

See [PDK Integration](pdk.md) for details of how this works. 

Since this is a major upgrade, you must re-init your project. Make sure all your
code is checked in to git, 
[install PDK](https://puppet.com/docs/pdk/1.x/pdk_install.html) then run:

```shell
gem install pdqtest
cd /my/project
pdqtest init
pdk bundle install
bundle exec pdqtest setup
```

## Custom facts
If you were previous using custom facts in the `spec/merge_facts` directory, 
these need to be converted to yaml and moved to `spec/default_facts.yml`. This
will give you compatibility between PDK unit tests and PDQTest acceptance tests.

## RSpec tests (inc hiera data)
PDQTest doesn't deal with RSPec tests any more, we let PDK do all the work by
shelling out to call `pdk test unit`:

* If you were using PDQTest for your hiera data during the RSpec lifecycle, 
  update your tests to do what PDK tells you to do
* Existing `spec/fixtures/hiera.yaml` and `spec/fixtures/test.yaml` files will
  continue to work during acceptance tests and the `hiera.yaml` file has been
  upgraded for hiera 5 compatibility. You will have to reconfigure your 
  hierarchy if you were using more files then just `test.yaml`

Old PDQTest generated RSpec tests will fail due to missing dependency on 
[puppet_factset](https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet_factset) gem which is now no
longer required (by anything üòÅ).

You can enable this gem in PDK by adding it to `Gemfile.project` and running
`pdk bundle install` or you can just rewrite your tests using the new PDK format
which looks like this:

```ruby
require 'spec_helper'

describe 'CHANGETHISTOYOURCLASSNAME' do
  on_supported_os.each do |os, os_facts|
    context "on #{os}" do
      let(:facts) { os_facts }

      it { is_expected.to compile }
    end
  end
end
```

If your in a hurry and have good acceptance tests, another quick fix would be to
just delete the RSpec tests and rely purely on real-world testing. You will miss 
fast-failure due to invalid puppet code if you do this though, since we have to
launch a container and run puppet to see if your code compiles.

You can use PDK to generate these tests, see the PDK manual for details of how.

## `/.fixtures.yml` and `/fixtures.yml`
`/.fixtures.yml` is back in PDQTest 2.0 (it's presence was an error in PDQTest 
1.x) and `/fixtures.yaml` is no longer used.

If you would like to use test fixtures from git, add them to `.fixtures.yml` and
you can continue to use them as before. The rest of the file is generated for
you automatically based on `metadata.json` to support integration with PDK.

[More info on dependencies](puppet_module_dependencies.md)

## Old PDQtest 1x integration points
* `/spec/spec_helper.rb`
* `/Gemfile`
* `/Rakefile`
* `/.rspec`
We will do our best to detect any previous PDQTest generated versions of these
files. If known versions are found, we will upgrade you to the PDK version. If
an unknown file is found we will stop and ask you to move it out of the way
first. PDK will be responsible for these files now-on.

### How to resolve `unknown/modified file` errors during upgrade
1. Move your existing file out of the way
2. Run `pdqtest init`
3. See per-file upgrade notes below

#### `/Gemfile`
Add any custom gems/`Gemfile` magic to `gemfile.project` and it will be evaluated
during `pdk bundle install`

### PDK Managed files
PDK regenerates files it manages you run `pdk update`. To customise these files
and have your changes persist between updates, you need to add them to 
`.sync.yml` which allows you to override _some_ settings in the 
[PDK default templates](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-templates/).

If the templates don't support the customisation you want, the advice from 
Puppet is to fork and customise that repository, then configure PDK to use it.

Consult the PDK documentation for instructions on how to do this. 

## `/Gemfile.project`
New file used for configuring which PDQTest gem to use (replaces customisation
of `Gemfile`)

## `/.gitignore`
We no longer install or manage `.gitignore` for you and we don't upgrade it
either. PDK ships a default version and we use that if the initial file is 
missing.

## `/cut` mountpoint
Previous versions of PDQTest mounted code at `/cut` (Code Under Test), the new
mountpoint is the more obvious `/testcase` and `/cut` no longer works.
