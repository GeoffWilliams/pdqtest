# Puppet facts
PDQTest uses a PDK compatible method to add facts to acceptance tests by
defining them in `spec/default_facts.yml`.

During acceptance tests, PDQTest will add these facts to the _real_ system facts
by installing them as external facts inside the container at one of:
* `/etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d/default_facts.yaml`
* `C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\facter\facts.d`

For use during unit tests, refer to PDK documentation.

## Older versions
PDQTest < 2.0 includes built-in 
[factsets](https://github.com/declarativesystems/puppet_factset) covering many
common operating systems, however, sometimes additional facts are needed 
throughout a module to mock an external fact or custom fact from a different 
module that is expected to be some known value.  In this case, creating the 
directory:

```
spec/merge_facts
```

Inside the module being tested will result in all JSON files contained being 
merged into all OS specific factsets used for testing as generated by 
`pdqtest generate_rspec`.

To put it simply, drop `.json` file(s) in this directory to add them to every
factset.  These facts will be made automatically avaialable to facter when 
running acceptance testing
