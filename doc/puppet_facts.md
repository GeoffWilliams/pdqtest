# Puppet facts
PDQTest includes built-in [factsets](https://github.com/declarativesystems/puppet_factset) covering many common operating systems, however, sometimes additional facts are needed throughout a module to mock an external fact or custom fact from a different module that is expected to be some known value.  In this case, creating the directory:

```
spec/merge_facts
```

Inside the module being tested will result in all JSON files contained being merged into all OS specific factsets used for testing as generated by `pdqtest generate_rspec`.

To put it simply, drop `.json` file(s) in this directory to add them to every factset.  These facts will be made automatically avaialable to facter when running acceptance testing
