# Puppet facts
PDQTest uses PDK's `spec/default_facts.yml` to add facts to acceptance tests as
external facts.

During test setup, PDQTest will installing the file at one of:
* `/etc/puppetlabs/facter/facts.d/default_facts.yaml`
* `C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\facter\facts.d`

PDK uses the file as part of the `pdk test unit` command. This way you have a 
consistent set of facts for both RSpec and acceptance testing, in the file that
PDK expects them to be in.

## 🐉 Differences from PDK 🐉
The above behaviour is not how PDK intends this file to be used as some other 
mechanism is supposed to be used for acceptance tests (see PDK manual).

It's pretty rare to actually need `spec/default_facts.yml` unless your doing
unit testing since you can insert custom facts as part of your test setup.

Be aware that PDK sets a few facts to specific values that we will pick up and
use in your acceptance tests:

```yaml
concat_basedir: "/tmp"
ipaddress: "172.16.254.254"
is_pe: false
macaddress: "AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA"
```

You would need to use a forked version of the PDK templates to fix these
properly, but your using the structured facts anyway so it makes no difference,
right...?

## Older versions
PDQTest < 2.0 includes built-in 
[factsets](https://github.com/declarativesystems/puppet_factset) covering many
common operating systems, however, sometimes additional facts are needed 
throughout a module to mock an external fact or custom fact from a different 
module that is expected to be some known value.  In this case, creating the 
directory:

```
spec/merge_facts
```

Inside the module being tested will result in all JSON files contained being 
merged into all OS specific factsets used for testing as generated by 
`pdqtest generate_rspec`.

To put it simply, drop `.json` file(s) in this directory to add them to every
factset.  These facts will be made automatically avaialable to facter when 
running acceptance testing
